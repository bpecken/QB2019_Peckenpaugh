I am a second year EEB graduate student in Leonie Moyle's lab. I study sexual selection and speciation in _Drosophila_. I am particularly interested in postcopulatory reproductive interactions, and diversity of female reproductive adaptations in natural _Drosophila_ populations. I have a cat named Arya.
